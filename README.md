# Project-Capstone-Project---Data-Wrangling
  Question : Create a short document (1-2 pages) in your github describing the data wrangling steps that you undertook to clean your capstone project data set. What kind of cleaning steps did you perform? How did you deal with missing values, if any? Were there outliers, and how did you decide to handle them? This document will eventually become part of your milestone report.

Answer:

In this project I am working with historical data about the stock prices of the publicly listed companies.
For this purpose I will be using dataset from Kaggle : Huge stock market Dataset.
The stock market Dataset is cleaned dataset.
This data has no missing values,outliers so I did not need to perform any Data wrangling steps to clean this dataset.
